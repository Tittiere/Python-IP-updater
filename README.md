This project is discontinued since Google removed "less secure apps access" to gmail.
From now on I will instead use outlook.

# Gmail IP Updater

This program sends you an email with your IP address every time it updates.
At first start a config.json file is generated. Compile it with your mail data.
Be sure to activate less secure apps access on your sender email gmail account.
